Here is the test task.
 
Please check out http://68.169.52.12/EnvyGram/html/ site. No special credentials are needed. You can create your own account for testing. Attached is a doc with mockups and some details about the functionality. Please note that web pages do not look exactly as on the mockups - final design is slightly different from mockups and thatâ€™s OK.
 
Let's assume that you were given a task to cover the web application above with automated tests (AT), in order to determine possible bugs and also have a way to do quick regression / integration testing in the future. We'd like you to demonstrate how you would do this by providing two things:
 
  1) Short description of the approach you would use for AT. The description should clarify things like these:
  What tools / frameworks would you use for AT?
  What for each tool would be used?
  What parts of the app you would apply AT to?
  Anything else you want to mention.
 
  2) Some automated tests created for the application that demonstrate your skills. We understand that it is not possible to cover a lot of functionality in this test task. So you can just limit your efforts to one or few parts of the system. If you can provide an initial version of a test plan - that would be just great.
 
Second part is of course more important.
